<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the context of most data science work, Python for loops are used to loop through an iterable object (like a list, tuple, set, etc.) and perform the same action for each entry. For example, a for loop would allow us to iterate through a list, performing the same action on each item in the list.</h2>
