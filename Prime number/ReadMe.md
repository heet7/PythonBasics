<h1>Logic behind prime number</h1>
<p>so , we have a number. what we need to check that number is only divisiable by 1 or that number<br> Right..</p>

<h1>Little more logic what if user input decimal number...</h1>

<p>now we use '//' this sighn let's see how...</p>

<p>
  x = 5 <br> x//2 <br> x = ? <br>
  <p>now x = 2 </p> 
  <p>why because when we devide than 2*2=4</p>
  <p>if we do 5/2 then the answer is 2.5 but  </p>
  <p>we devided 5 b // 2 using this method so we get result of the devision is 2</p>
  <p>so moral of the story we don't get 11.5 we got 11</p>
</p>

<h3>ok bit confusion</h3>
<p>so,for example 23 last number devided by is 11.5 right... so what we do we have stop as 11 because 11.5 is not a integer number. 23 // 2 = 11</p>
